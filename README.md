The Seven Bridges of Königsberg
==================================================

Welcome to the source page for Seven Bridges.  Make sure to [check out our front page](http://zgrossbart.github.com/bridges/) for more information and some cool videos.

The city of Königsberg in Prussia (now [Kaliningrad, Russia](https://maps.google.com/maps?q=Kaliningrad,+Russia&hl=en&ie=UTF8&ll=54.704615,20.515723&spn=0.01246,0.033023&sll=42.036922,-71.683501&sspn=4.140734,3.416748&hnear=Kaliningrad,+%D1%82.%D0%BF.%D0%B3.+%D0%9A%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B3%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B4,+Kaliningrad+Oblast,+Russia&t=m&z=16)) was built around two rivers with [seven bridges](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Bridges_of_K%C3%B6nigsberg). For years the residents tried to cross each bridge without crossing any of them more than once.

[Leonhard Euler](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler) proved that it was impossible to cross all the bridges without repeating and laid the foundation for graph theory and modern topology at the same time.

This project is an iPad and iPhone game based on those famous bridges.  Each level presents a puzzle with bridges to cross, houses to visit, and sometimes coins to collect.
